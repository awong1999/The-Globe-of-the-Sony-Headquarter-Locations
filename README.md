3D Globe HACKED by [Aaron Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronanthonywong/) and [Marc Savet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcsavet/). 

Originally created by [John](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/author/j_nelson/) and [Raluca](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/author/raluca_zurich/) after getting inspired by [this awesome globe](https://www.fonterra.com/nz/en/campaign/from-here-to-everywhere.html#/home), [this awesome globe](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt8zyI-gsqW/) and [this globe by Vizzuality](https://www.half-earthproject.org/maps/). 

John and Ralucal used [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) to create the interactive globe and [ArcGIS Pro](https://pro.arcgis.com/) to create the basemap. They also used this [cloud image](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=57747) from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (image by Reto St√∂ckli) for the cloud layer.
